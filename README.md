# RADS
University C++ coursework - Remote Aeroplane Diagnostic System. It simulated sensor readers on an aeroplane.

It contains a Visual Studio (I used 2015) solution that contains different projects.

* RADS_common - common library for all the projects
* RADS_server - server-side application
* RADS_client - client-side application
